# YouTube-QNA-Chatbot
We have developed a YouTube Q&A chatbot designed to answer questions based on any YouTube video link provided by the user. The chatbot leverages advanced natural language processing techniques to deliver precise and comprehensive answers.

Initially, the chatbot extracts the transcript of the specified YouTube video. Using a question-answering model from Hugging Face, it identifies the most relevant sections of the transcript that answer the user's question. This context is then passed to a GPT-2 model, which extends and refines the answer, ensuring it is both informative and coherent.

By combining the strengths of the Hugging Face Q&A model for pinpointing accurate responses and GPT-2 for generating detailed and natural language answers, our chatbot provides users with an enhanced, interactive experience for extracting information from YouTube videos.
